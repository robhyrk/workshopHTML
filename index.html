        <h2>Questions? We have answers!</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>What happens if my package is lost?</li>
            <span>A: Our delivery system sends a beacon to other porters in our network to notify them of lost packages that they can pick up and continue the delivery.</span>
            <li>How do I know my porter is not a raider in disguise?</li>
            <span>A: All of our porters carry ID badges that our biometrically linked. Before answering any deliveries please ensure you scan their ID badge.</span>
            <li>I think my porter was captured by raiders. What can I do?</li>
            <span>A: Unfortunately raiders have become prominent in certain delivery areas. If you think your porter has been captured please contact us and we will
                send a team to have them rescued.
